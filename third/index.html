			<h1>The IT Crowd</h1>
			<p>Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them!... Actually, that doesn't work, as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages. They just toss us away like yesterday's jam. See the driver hooks a function by patching the system call table, so its not safe to unload it unless another thread's about to jump in there and do its stuff, and you don't want to end up in the middle of invalid memory! No, that's the music you hear when... I'm sorry are you from the past? I've got Aunt Irma visiting. Oh, do you not like Aunt Irma? I've got an aunt like that. When I started Reynholm Industries, I had just two things in my possession: a dream and 6 million pounds. No, that's the music you hear when... I'm sorry are you from the past?</p>
			<p>JI'll put this over here, with the rest of the fire. Yeah, you need to turn it on... uh, the button turns it on. Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them!... Actually, that doesn't work, as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages. You know, it's high tide. But we're not on the coast. I'm closed for maintenance! Closed for maintenance? I've fallen to the communists! Well, they do have some strong arguments. They just toss us away like yesterday's jam. Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services. From today, dialing 999 won't get you the Emergency Services, and that's not the only thing that's changing!</p>
			<p>I'm a 32 year old IT-man who works in a basement. Yes, I do the whole Lonely Hearts thing! Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? Huh, what you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you. Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN! From today, dialing 999 won't get you the Emergency Services, and that's not the only thing that's changing! Yeah, you need to turn it on... uh, the button turns it on. You can come down here any time and I'll be waiting for you! [slams down phone] That told her!</p>
			<p>While he was eating, did you hear anyone laughing? Like... in the kitchen area? Yes! Yes I did, actually, yes I did. That'd be trouser food! No, no, that's the music you heard when it come on. We don't need no education. Yes you do. You've just used a double negative. How long have you been disabled? Ten years? Ten years, and how did it happen? If that's not a rude question. Acid? Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot? When I started Reynholm Industries, I had just two things in my possession: a dream and 6 million pounds. Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services.</p>
			<p>Carrie, Moss! First scene in Carrie! Oh. Okay No, no, that's the music you heard when it come on. I'm going to murder you... You bloody woman! Dear Sir stroke Madam. Fire, exclamation mark. Fire, exclamation mark. Help me, exclamation mark. 123 Carrendon Road. Looking forward to hearing from you. All the best, Maurice Moss. Carrie, Moss! First scene in Carrie! Oh. Okay Huh, what you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you. No, no there you go, no there you go. I just heard it come on.</p>
